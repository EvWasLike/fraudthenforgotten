Fraud, then Forgotten: How Defense Contractors Get Away With Defrauding the Government

There are multiple instances over the past decade of the United States military being overcharged or defrauded by private military contractors. To that end, we wanted to examine some of the more egregious examples of fraud private defense contractors perpetuate.

We found a vast history of contractors defrauding the government, paying minute fines in comparison to their contracts, and these same contractors continuing to enter contracts with the government.

One such contractor is EOTech, who agreed to pay $25.6 million to the US Government in November 2015 to settle allegations that company defrauded numerous defense and military organizations over a 10-year period. The two stories, "A Decade of Fraud" and "A Pattern of Inaction" chronicle EOTech's fraudulent activities and the lack of repercussions from the government. Our timeline also chronicles EOTech's fraudulent dealings.

EOTech is hardly the only defense contractor doing this. Companies such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin all engage in similar practices. We created a database of the instances of fraud and the penalties for selected Department of Defense contractors.
