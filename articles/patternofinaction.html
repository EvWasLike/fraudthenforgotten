		<h1>A Pattern of Inaction</h1>

			<p>In fiscal year 2014, the top ten contractors alone were awarded $117.7 billion in government contracts.</p>

			<p>"There's a history of a private arsenals as opposed to public arsenals in the wake of WWII," said Benjamin Friedman of the Cato Institute.</p>

			<p>Defense contracting grew out of a need for the government to be able to quickly mobilize businesses and ramp up production in response to varying global events. It's easier to temporarily hire a contractor than it is to hire and fire fulltime government employees, said Friedman.</p>

			<p>Essentially, Friedman explained, the contracting system allows an agency of the US government to procure specific items or to research new technology without creating an entire department within the agency. For instance: instead of purchasing and manufacturing small arms in government owned and operated plants, the Department of Defense can use existing private arms companies to quickly furnish the needed supplies.</p>

			<p>"Though it can be bogged down by politics and the costs of doing business in Washington, ideally, allowing the government to employ private businesses will increase efficiency," said Friedman. Friedman adds that the system looks much more chaotic and clumsy from the outside.</p>

			<p>"For contracting officers, this is just the nature of the system," he said.</p>

			<p>The scope of the modern defense contracting system means that contractors are often left to police themselves by internal audit (for financial fraud like overcharging/mischarging for labor) or by contractual obligation (if providing materials or products) said Neil Gordon from the Project on Government Oversight.</p>

			<p>"The largest contractors should constantly be auditing themselves. It's the easiest way to make sure that they can continue to do business with the US," said Friedman. "The government will generally accept errors and won't hold contractors who admit mistakes liable."</p>

			<p>"Accounting errors and billing mistakes do happen. A lot of discrepancies between contractors and the government come down to human error, not malice," said Gordon.</p>

			<p>Gordon concurred with Friedman's assessment, adding that contractors that adopt a policy of transparency after a mistake typically continue to do business with the US.</p>

			<p>William Schmidt, of the GSA's Suspension and Debarment Division declined to say how often investigators recommend suspension or debarment when misconduct is discovered. He also declined to say often contracting officials actually use their ability to suspend or debar offending contractors.</p>

			<p>EOTech's pattern of fraud is notable for its duration and the rigorous internal documentation that ultimately implicated the company. Yet EOTech is just one company competing for billions of dollars in defense contracts. It's one company among many that have settled allegations of fraud without debarment or suspension.</p>  

			<p>The General Services Administration's (GSA) Suspension and Disbarment Division keeps track of contractors that are under investigation or have been debarred but does not investigate fraud or misconduct on their own, said William Schmidt, from the SDO (Suspension & Disbarment Office).</p>

			<p>However, under the Federal Acquisition Regulations, debarment and suspension are considered separate from criminal or civil charges and are not decided by attorneys, said Schmidt.</p>

			<p>Schmidt explained that there are often extenuating circumstances that prevent contracting officials from suspending companies. Oftentimes, companies are providing invaluable service to the government, said Schmidt.</p>

			<p>"Debarment is entirely at the discretion of the contracting official," said Gordon, of POGO. "It's subjective. Even when a company acknowledges wrongdoing, it's perfectly legal for them to continue bidding on contracts."</p>
